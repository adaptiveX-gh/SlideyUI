# Padding Fix Validation

## Issue
The padding prop on SlideyUI cards was not working - text appeared flush against the left edge with no spacing.

## Root Cause
The padding variant CSS classes (`.slide-card-compact`, `.slide-card-spacious`, `.slide-card-flush`) were defined in `components.css` but never loaded by the Tailwind plugin. The plugin only generated inline CSS-in-JS styles, which didn't include these classes.

## Fix Applied
Modified `packages/slideyui-core/src/index.ts` to include:

1. **CSS Variables** (added to `:root`):
   - `--card-spacing-xs` through `--card-spacing-3xl` (8px to 64px scale)
   - `--card-padding`: 32px default
   - `--card-padding-compact`: 24px
   - `--card-padding-spacious`: 48px

2. **Component Styles** (added to plugin):
   - `.slide-card`: Updated to use `var(--card-padding)`
   - `.slide-card-compact`: Uses compact padding (24px)
   - `.slide-card-spacious`: Uses spacious padding (48px)
   - `.slide-card-flush`: No padding (0px)
   - `.slide-card-header`, `.slide-card-title`, `.slide-card-description`, `.slide-card-body`, `.slide-card-footer`

## Files Modified
- `D:\Users\scale\Code\SlideyUI\packages\slideyui-core\src\index.ts`

## Validation Steps

### 1. Verify Build Output
```bash
cd packages/slideyui-core
npm run build
grep "slide-card-compact" dist/index.js
```
**Expected:** Should find the class name in the output
**Result:** ✓ PASS - Classes found in build

### 2. Test in Documentation
```bash
cd docs
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `/docs/layouts` and inspect the "Padding Variants" section.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cards with `padding="compact"` should have 24px padding
- Cards with `padding="default"` should have 32px padding
- Cards with `padding="spacious"` should have 48px padding
- Cards with `padding="none"` should have 0px padding
- Text should NOT be flush against the edges

**Inspect in DevTools:**
- Check that `.slide-card-compact` class is present in the DOM
- Check that the class has `padding: var(--card-padding-compact)`
- Check that `--card-padding-compact` resolves to `1.5rem` (24px)

### 3. Test in React Package
The React package uses the same Tailwind plugin, so the fix should work automatically.

```bash
cd examples/react-demo
npm run dev
```

Test with:
```tsx
<ContentCard title="Test" padding="compact">
  <p>This should have 24px padding</p>
</ContentCard>
```

### 4. Verify CSS Specificity
The padding variant classes should override the base `.slide-card` padding because they:
1. Are defined after `.slide-card` in the component styles
2. Have the same specificity (single class selector)
3. CSS cascade rules apply - later rules win

## Expected Results
- ✓ CSS variables defined in `:root`
- ✓ Padding classes compiled into plugin output
- ✓ Classes available in Tailwind build
- ✓ Components apply padding correctly
- ✓ Text has proper spacing from card edges
- ✓ All padding variants work as expected

## Status
**FIX APPLIED** - Core package rebuilt successfully. Awaiting validation in documentation site.
