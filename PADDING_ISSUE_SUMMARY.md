# Card Padding Issue - Complete Analysis

## Problem
Cards have NO padding - all text is flush against the edges.

## What We've Tried

### 1. Fixed Tailwind Import Path ✅
- Changed `import slideyUI from 'slideyui'` to `import slideyUI from '@slideyui/core'`
- This made the plugin START loading (we saw "✨ SlideyUI loaded" message)

### 2. Added CSS Variables & Padding Classes ✅
- Added to `packages/slideyui-core/src/index.ts`:
  - CSS variables: `--card-padding`, `--card-spacing-*`
  - Component classes: `.slide-card`, `.slide-card-compact`, etc.
- Rebuilt the package

### 3. Current Issue ❌
The Tailwind plugin is loaded but **NOT generating the CSS**.

**Evidence**:
- Running `npx tailwindcss` shows NO `.slide-card` classes in output
- The plugin loading message appeared initially but now doesn't show
- `console.log` debug statements in plugin don't execute

## Root Cause

The issue appears to be that **Tailwind is not executing the plugin function** during CSS generation, even though:
- The plugin exports correctly
- The import path is correct
- The plugin is in the Tailwind config
- No JavaScript errors

## Likely Cause

Tailwind might be CACHING the plugin or there's a Vite HMR issue preventing the plugin from re-executing.

## Solution to Try

1. **Full Clean Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # Kill all servers
   pkill -f "npm run dev"

   # Clean everything
   cd docs
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite .svelte-kit

   # Rebuild core
   cd ../packages/slideyui-core
   npm run build

   # Restart docs
   cd ../../docs
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work**: Add `.slide-card` to Tailwind's `safelist` to prevent JIT purging

3. **Nuclear option**: Use `@layer components` directive directly in a CSS file instead of the plugin
