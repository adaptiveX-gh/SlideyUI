# New Slide Types Implementation Summary

## Overview

Four new specialized slide types have been added to the SlideyUI MCP server, along with significant enhancements to the existing timeline slide for roadmap functionality.

## New Slide Types

### 1. Team/Profile Cards (`team`)
**Purpose**: Showcase team members with photos, roles, bios, and social links

**Features**:
- Three layout modes: `grid`, `carousel`, `highlight`
- Photo support with automatic initials fallback
- Social media links (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub) with icons
- Bio text with markdown support
- Responsive grid layout

**Files Created**:
- `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/templates/team.ts` - Template implementation
- Schema added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/schema/index.ts`
- Types added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/types/index.ts`

### 2. Pricing Tables (`pricing`)
**Purpose**: Display pricing plans in a comparison-friendly format

**Features**:
- Support for 1-4 pricing plans
- Highlight specific plans (recommended badge)
- Feature list with checkmark icons
- Flexible pricing (string or number)
- Custom CTA buttons
- Responsive grid layout (1, 2, 3, or 4 columns)

**Files Created**:
- `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/templates/pricing.ts` - Template implementation
- Schema added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/schema/index.ts`
- Types added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/types/index.ts`

### 3. Code Snippets (`code`)
**Purpose**: Display code with syntax highlighting and line numbers

**Features**:
- Built-in regex-based syntax highlighting (no external dependencies)
- Line numbers
- Line highlighting (specify which lines to emphasize)
- Optional filename display
- Theme support: `dark`, `light`, `auto`
- 20+ supported languages:
  - JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, TSX
  - Python, Java, C/C++, C#
  - Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby
  - Swift, Kotlin, Scala
  - HTML, CSS, SCSS, XML
  - JSON, YAML
  - SQL
  - Bash, Shell, PowerShell
  - Markdown

**Files Created**:
- `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/templates/code.ts` - Template implementation with syntax highlighter
- Schema added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/schema/index.ts`
- Types added to `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/types/index.ts`

### 4. Enhanced Timeline/Roadmap (Timeline Enhancement)
**Purpose**: Enhanced timeline with roadmap-specific features

**New Features Added**:
- **Modes**: `timeline` (original) or `roadmap` (enhanced)
- **Status Badges**: `planned`, `in-progress`, `completed` with icons
- **Progress Indicators**: 0-100% progress bars
- **Milestones**: Special milestone markers (star icons)
- **Grouping**: Group events by `quarter`, `month`, or `year`
- **Quarter Support**: Tag events with quarters (e.g., "Q1 2024")
- **Dependencies**: Track dependencies between timeline items

**Files Modified**:
- `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/templates/timeline.ts` - Enhanced with roadmap features
- Schema updated in `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/schema/index.ts`
- Types updated in `packages/slideyui-mcp/src/types/index.ts`

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

All new slide types follow the established SlideyUI MCP architecture:

1. **Schema Definition** (`schema/index.ts`)
   - Zod schemas for runtime validation
   - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
   - Type-safe with strict validation rules

2. **TypeScript Types** (`types/index.ts`)
   - Exported interfaces for all specs
   - Added to `SlideType` union
   - Added to `SlideSpec` union

3. **Template Implementation** (`templates/*.ts`)
   - HTML generation using SlideyUI CSS classes
   - Markdown support via `renderMarkdown()`
   - HTML escaping via `escapeHTML()`
   - Responsive and accessible markup

4. **Template Registration** (`templates/index.ts`)
   - Registered in `templateRegistry` Map
   - Exported for direct use
   - Type-safe template resolution

### Key Design Decisions

1. **No External Dependencies for Syntax Highlighting**
   - Used regex-based highlighting to avoid adding `shiki` or `prismjs`
   - Keeps package lightweight
   - Sufficient for presentation use cases
   - Can be easily upgraded to external library if needed

2. **Backward Compatible Timeline**
   - Original timeline behavior preserved with `mode: 'timeline'`
   - New roadmap features only active with `mode: 'roadmap'`
   - Existing presentations continue to work without changes

3. **Flexible Pricing Display**
   - Auto-detects number of plans and adjusts grid
   - Supports both numeric and string prices (e.g., "Custom", "Free")
   - Recommended badge separate from highlight feature

4. **Team Layout Flexibility**
   - Grid layout for 2+ members
   - Highlight layout for featuring single key person
   - Carousel layout reserved for future enhancement
